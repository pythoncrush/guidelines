[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well, it's the M-I-crooked letter, comin' around the South
Rollin' straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothin' but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bendin' corners in my 'Lac, boy, 'cause that's how we be rollin' here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kickin' the khakis and Adidas, packin' your heaters 'cause you supposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rollin' steady in that Caddy, but them fifty bottles got to go
See, juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginnin'
Now I'm just a player, sippin' sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee
Niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid 'cause it ain't nothin' to see

[Verse 2: André 3000]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise your block? The one and only OutKast
Many a niggas fallin' fast and
I continue blastin'
Swiftly, they ain't gon' get me, got somethin' for 'em
The devil up in your grill and you still don't even know him
Show him who's the okay
Like collard greens and hoecakes, I got soul
That's somethin' that you ain't got
That's why your style is rotten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothin' but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen, got my pockets, business boomin' like rockets
Folks try to stop it, but they know that it's that
See rap shows near Hollywood
Get tickets as low as $72

[Chorus: Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillacfunkymuzik
Now, players if you choose it, you better make sure you don't abuse it
We're gonna get you high (Southernplayalistic)
High (Southernplayalistic)

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes, then I yell, "Ho"
And knock 'em up off they feet like a Southern hustler 'posed to do
I's in the house like— House like— a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Takin' 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sittin' off in a Brougham
I'm packin' my tag backwards if you wanna be actin' wrong
Word is bond like super glue
It's funky like pooper-scoop
And every word I say, you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well, okey dokey, 'Kast out, I swear to God I got the highest boomin' Cadillac
The expialalistic Coupe de Ville, can you handle that, you rat?
I take my time cruisin' 'round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers is your final curtain call
The one, two to the gauge, P-U-M-P
You wanna do a jack, I heat the barrel 'til it's empty, get me?
See, I ain't friendly, gettin' in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the Southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit, but don't try gafflin' me
'Cause sleep and you'll get served with some Southern hospitality
